# Ebb and Feel
#### _Ebb and Feel is a game of balance and stability. Find your inner peace or let the insanity consume you_

Ebb and Feel is a game produced for Ludum Dare #49 in 72 hours with a team of ten under the theme "Unstable".
Note there is a Unity remake version of this game which I created alone: https://github.com/baconeta/unity-ebb-and-feel-remake
